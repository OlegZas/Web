                Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was born in a small German village called Röcken, on October 15, 1844. Throughout his brilliant but brief career, he wrote several monumental works which still play a major role in modern philosophy. His writings on individuality and morality in contemporary civilization contributed to the thinking of scholars such as Martin Heidegger, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud. In the last decade of his life, he suffered from insanity and dies on August 25, 1900, at the age of 55.

            <h2 id="tribute-info"> Master Morality</h2>
            <p id="tribute-text">
             “What determines good, bad, or evil?”, and, “Why it does?”. A substantive attempt to investigate this issue was conducted by Nietzsche in his work “On the Genealogy of Morals”.  Unlike his contemporaries, whose ideas were limited by the philosophical beliefs of the time period, Nietzsche endeavored to study the origins of morality by submerging himself into the phase of humanity’s gestation during which the moral values were conceived. This was accomplished by conducting an etymological analysis of the word “good” which allowed Nietzsche to spot the fundamental similarities between the words “good”, “powerful”, “noble”, and “privileged”, that are common to many languages. For instance, in Russian language the word “благородный” [noble/honorable], meaning someone of noble birth, is derived from the word “благо” which literally translates to English as “good”. Unsurprisingly, the similarities between the roots of the words “bad” and “common”, “plebian”, and “low”, were also clearly identified  “German word schlecht [bad] itself: which is identical with schlicht [plain, simple]- compare schlechtweg [plainly], schlechterdings [simply]…” (Nietzsche, 464). This etymological analysis of the wordage and the study of the designations of the words in the ancient Greek texts, induced Nietzsche to theorize that originally, the rich, the strong, and the literate, were the only ones capable of mass-creating values and naming them in accordance with their perception of themselves and the outside world. As such, they assigned positive connotations to the words which they used to describe themselves “The “well-born” felt themselves to be the “happy”; they did not have to establish their happiness artificially by examining their enemies, or to persuade themselves, deceive themselves, that they were happy” (Nietzsche, 474). This way the noble people created the concept of “good” which they inevitably tied to themselves. Then, after realization of the vast disparities between themselves and the poor, the rich created the concept of “bad” to further separate themselves from those who possessed the undesired traits and qualities, “its negative concept “low,” “common,” “bad” is only a subsequently-inverted pale, contrasting image in relation to its positive basic concept – filled with life and passion through and through” (Nietzsche, 473). This shows that the concept of “good” was created by the nobleman as an inner process of self-description, which in turn, entailed the creation of the “contrasting shade”, the concept of “bad” - used to describe the unfortunate ones. Nietzsche labels this moral stance of the noblemen, as the master morality.

            <h2 id="tribute-info"> Slave Morality</h2>
            <p id="tribute-text">
                Just like the sheep, the poor were largely valued as nothing but the tools the exploitation of which allowed the rich to keep up their wealthy status. The physical inability, as well as the dreadful financial situation, prevented the former from confronting the latter and attempting to change the status quo. The lack of strength and power necessary for the pursuit of goals and riches excluded the weak from the joyful consumption of life’s pleasures which were an essential part of the nobles’ happy life. One can argue, that the internal and external suffering which satiated the everyday life of the common folk, led to the rise of the priestly caste somewhere in the darkest corners of the plebeian workshops. Nevertheless, Nietzsche believed that the priestly caste, originally, consisted of the weak members of the nobility who were not capable to carry out the military actions or adventurous activities inherent to the knightly aristocrats “The priestly noble mode of valuation presupposes, as we have seen, other things: it is disadvantageous for it when it comes to war!” (Nietzsche, 469). Therefore, the mere existence of the strong, constantly reminded the weak of their impotence which in turn generated the tormenting feelings of envy, hatred, and more importantly, ressentiment, and served as the true trigger of the battle for morality. Although, Nietzsche argues that the goal of the priestly caste in the battle for morality was to obtain an imaginary revenge for their impotence,  “ressentiment of natures that are denied the true reaction, that of deeds, and compensate themselves with an imaginary revenge”, it is hard not to protest that their revenge was anything but imaginary (Nietzsche, 472). In fact, it dilated to the scale of the complete ideological reversal, the final blow of which - the crucifixion of the Jesus of Nazareth, definitively eliminated the possibility of the recovery of the master morality. Instead, it led to the ultimate triumph of the priestly caste, identifiable by thorough integration of the reversed system of morals, into the mental mechanisms of the society. Nietzsche referred to this inversed human mentality as slave morality. In the simplest terms, the slave morality can be characterized as the justification, and even admiration, of the negative human qualities, such as inaction, poverty, impotence, and weakness, by those who possess them. It is equivalent to the shift in one’s stance and perception, from negative to positive, of the dismal status quo, if he or she doesn’t have the ability to affect it  “Weakness is being lied into something meritorious….and impotence which does not requite into “goodness of heart”; anxious lowliness into “humility”; subjection to those one hates into “obedience” (Nietzsche,  483). To elaborate further, think of a hypothetical scenario taking place in the workshop where the blacksmith is faced with the task of melting the life-carrying vessels and forging them into the deadly weapons. It is obvious, that although the raw component of these two objects is the same, their purpose of usage is drastically different. Well, in a fashion similar to that of the blacksmith in the workshop, the priests, utilized the raw materials presented to them by the noblemen in the form of “weak = bad; powerful = good”, and with the help of tools, personified by the martyrs, forged them into completely inversed “weak = good; powerful = evil”.

              <h2 id="tribute-info"> Conclusion</h2>
            <div id="img-caption"><img id="lastimage" src="ubermensch1.jpg" alt="overman"><br>"Overman"</div><p id="tribute-text">
                Throughout the two millennia, this slave morality served and still serves, as the shepherd guiding and protecting the sheep from the realization of the possibility to act, fight, and challenge the status quo. Although the religious staples are rapidly losing their tenacity, the moral values contained by them over generations are still an integral part of the societal thinking mechanism. In fact, at this stage one can argue that the moral values have detached from their religious origin and gained a separate existence as something eternal and apparent. Quite possibly, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this set of morals guiding humanity through its course of existence. However, the possibility of the excessive dependence on the omniscient and omnipotent shepherd, who will punish the active ones if they dare to pursue personal agendas, can without a doubt transform the sheep into defective tools, the only purpose of which is to serve as sustenance.

Translated by Walter Kaufmann, Random House, Inc., 2000. </a><br/><span id="annotation">In this masterpiece, Friedrich Nietzsche attempts to evaluate the essence of the system of morals that serves as an invisible hand that guides the activities of humanity. The work consists of three essays that are centered around the concepts of resentment (Essay 1), guilt (Essay 2), and asceticism and will (Essay 3). Based on the analysis of the historical use of the language, Nietzsche makes a groundbreaking claim that the present morals are outdated and constrain the development of the unique virtues in the individual. He attempts to convince the readers about the necessity to follow one’s aspirations and abandon the morals whose purpose is to restrict one’s will. </span></p>
