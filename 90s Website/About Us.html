    <p> PlayStation, video game console released in 1994 by Sony Computer Entertainment. 
        The PlayStation, one of a new generation of 32-bit consoles, signaled 
        Sony’s rise to power in the video game world. Also known as the PS One, 
        the PlayStation used compact discs (CDs), heralding the video game industry’s 
        move away from cartridges.<br/><br/>
    
         After a failed venture with Nintendo to release the PlayStation as the Super 
        Nintendo Entertainment System–CD in the early 1990s, Sony made the decision to
         market its own console. The PlayStation was released in Japan in December 1994, 
         and it made its American debut in September 1995; both releases elicited critical 
         acclaim and impressive sales. Titles such as Twisted Metal and Ridge Racer were very
          popular. By 2005 the PlayStation had become the first console ever to ship 100 million
           units. PlayStation’s premier games included fan favourites such as Final Fantasy 7,
            Crash Bandicoot, and Tekken, all of which spawned numerous sequels.
